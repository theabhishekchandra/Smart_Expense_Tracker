## App Overview
The Smart Daily Expense Tracker helps small business owners manage daily expenses efficiently.  
Users can:
- Add expenses with title, amount, category, optional notes, and optional receipt images.  
- View expenses for today, previous days, or last 7 days.  
- Group expenses by category or date.  
- Generate reports with daily totals, category totals, and bar charts.  
- Export and share expense data as CSV (simulated PDF support).  

This app is built with **Jetpack Compose**, **MVVM architecture**, and **StateFlow** for modern Android best practices.

## AI Usage Summary
AI tools were leveraged extensively to accelerate development:  
- **ChatGPT**: Generated Jetpack Compose layouts, reusable components, ViewModel logic, and report aggregation functions.  
- **GitHub Copilot**: Assisted in writing boilerplate code, repository functions, and CSV export logic.  
- **AI-assisted UX & Validation**: Suggested input validation, duplicate detection, and performance improvements.
